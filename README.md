# arqastwb
toolbox to perform archaeoastronomical studies

It implements the Meeus' Astronomical Algorithms in order to deal with Julian days, degrees, hour angles and to predict the horizontal and equatorial coordinates of the Sun, Mooon, naked-eye visible planets and stars. It also provides functions to get the julian days of solstices, equinoxes and cross-quarter days in a period of time, and models the brightness of the sky during twilight allowing ro calculate the dates of heliacal and acronic rising and setting of several stars. To end up, some functions are provided to obtain the horizontal coordinates of alignments from the geographical coordinates of the backsight and foresight and to assess statistically if they are due just to random chance.
